# Translations

We recently changed the way we handle translations so that we can later provide the ability to switch the language for different with a Learning Locker installation. This [issue was discussed on Github](https://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker/issues/387). All languages are now provided in the `app/lang` directory. We currently support the following languages:

- English
- Spanish (partly)


We are looking for people interested in translating Learning Locker. If you would like to help out, please maintain translations via the `app/lang` directory in our Github repository. We were previously using a service called Transiflex, you can visit the [Learning Locker page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/learning-locker/) on there to import previous translations that may not have made it into the Github repository.
