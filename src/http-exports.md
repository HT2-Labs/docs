# Exports HTTP Interface

This holds queries which are then used to export data form learning locker.

It is accessible through the following HTTP interfaces:

- [Connection HTTP Interface](../http-connection) via http://www.example.org/api/connection/export.
- [REST HTTP Interface](../http-rest) via http://www.example.org/api/v2/export.

projection | An array of stringified json mongo projection queries. [See mongo docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/)
