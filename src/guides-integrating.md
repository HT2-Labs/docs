# Integrating your LRS Guide
If you're planning to integrate a service with Learning Locker, you should firstly consider if you can use an existing integration between the service and the xAPI or Learning Locker. A [list of the known existing integrations](#existing-integrations) has been provided below.

If a tool does not already exist, then you should consider if creating the integration yourself is going to be too costly or challenging to implement. If this is the case, you can contact us via [hello@learninglocker.net](mailto:hello@learninglocker.net) to discuss your needs and gain advice using our experience.

If you've decided you're going to implement the integration yourself, you're probably most interested in our guides for [inserting statements](../guides-inserting) and/or [retrieving statements](../guides-retrieving). You may also be interested in viewing the documentation for our HTTP interfaces especially our [xAPI HTTP interface](../http-xapi).

## Existing Integrations
- [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) via the [Logstore plugin](https://moodle.org/plugins/logstore_xapi) that we originally developed and released.
- [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) via our own internal tool, contact [hello@learninglocker.net](mailto:hello@learninglocker.net) for more information.
- [Blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com/learning-management-system/blackboard-learn.aspx) via [JISC's Blackboard xAPI Plugin](https://github.com/jiscdev/blackboard-xapi-plugin/wiki).
- [Articulate Storyline](https://community.articulate.com/articles/introduction-to-the-tin-can-api-aka-xapi).
