# Upgrading

## Upgrading via Github with Git
If you've downloaded Learning Locker using Git you will need to upgrade like this.

1. If this is your first time upgrading, run `git checkout -b local && git add -A && git commit -am 'Local changes.'`.
2. Run `git fetch --tags`.
3. Run `git merge TAG`. Where TAG is the release (i.e. "v1.3.4").
4. Run `php composer.phar install`.
5. Run `php artisan migrate --env=YOUR_ENV` where `YOUR_ENV` should be replaced with your environment (likely to be local or production).
