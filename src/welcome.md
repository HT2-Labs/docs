# Welcome

Learning Locker is a conformant, open source, Learning Record Store started by [HT2 Labs](https://www.ht2labs.com); a type of data repository designed to store learning activity statements generated by xAPI (Tin Can) compliant learning activities. This documentation site is intended to explain how to use Learning Locker, for a description of Learning Locker and more please see the [Learning Locker website](https://learninglocker.net/).

> Learning Locker only supports xAPI v1.0 and above. It is not suitable for platforms still using an earlier version of xAPI. At this time there are no plans to provide backwards compatibility for older versions of the spec.
