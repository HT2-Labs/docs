# Migrating from V1 to V2 Guide
Before migrating from version 1, you will need to [install version 2](../guides-installing) with a blank database.

Once you have version 2 successfully installed and working, you'll need to [use the migration tool](#) which will download your version 1 database, migrate your data to version 2, and upload the migrated data into your version 2 database.

Note that the migration tool will also copy your xAPI documents and attachments, but currently we only provide support for moving files from and to local storage and s3 storage.
