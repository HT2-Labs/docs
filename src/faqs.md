#### I can't use my custom extensions in queries
When Leanring Locker stores extensions, the dots in the keys are replaced with `&46;` because Mongo does not allow dots in keys. You can find more information in the [Aggregation HTTP Interface documentation](../http-aggregation#projecting-with-extension-keys).
