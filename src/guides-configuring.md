# Configuring Learning Locker

Both the UI/API/Worker and xAPI Service require a `.env` file which will contain all the configuration variables required the application to run.

Where applicable, both of these files will need to have the same values (e.g. in order to connect to the same database).

Both repositories contain .env.example templates which can be copied as new `.env` files. If the application has been installed using the install script then this step will be performed for you.
