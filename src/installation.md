## Requirements
Learning Locker requires the components listed below. Learning Locker is built upon the excellent [Laravel](http://laravel.com) PHP framework, so in addition to the components below, please see the [Laravel requirements](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2#server-requirements).

* [PHP 5.5](http://php.net)
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
* [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org)
* [MongoDB php extension](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php)
* [Node and NPM](http://nodejs.org)
* [Bower](http://bower.io)

## Download and Install
To download and install Learning Locker, you need to run the commands below.

    git clone git@github.com:LearningLocker/learninglocker.git learninglocker
    cd learninglocker
    composer install

## Setup MongoDB
Make sure you have MongoDB set up with your db credentials added to `app/config/local/database.php` (or `app/config/database.php` depending on your `bootstrap/start.php` file) inside `connections` under `mongodb`. Then run the command below.

    php artisan migrate

If you're upgrading please check the [release notes](https://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker/releases) for any further steps.

## Register your first user
Go to `yoursite/register` and create the first user.

- Your first user will become your instance's super user. See [adminstration](../adminstration) for more information.
- If you've not setup emails, manually verify your email.
  1. Click on "users" (left hand sidebar)
  2. Click the grey verified button next to your user (it will turn green with a tick)

## Configuration
By default the `app/config/local` configuration will be used if you access Learning Locker via your localhost. You can change various settings such as debug mode, default language and timezone in `app/config/app.php`.

## Quirks
1. Depending on your set up, you may need to append "public" to your site URL e.g. "yoursite.com/public/".
2. MongoDB doesnâ€™t allow full stops (".") in keys. Therefore, we replace all full stops in keys with "&46;" on incoming objects (such as statements) and the opposite on outgoing objects.
