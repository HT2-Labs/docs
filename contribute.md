### Pull requests

The best way to get started with pull requests is to create a ticket in our tracker then address the issue / enhancement in your pull request. If the pull request is in response to a bug, then no extra detail is required, however, if you are proposing new functionality or a rewrite of existing code, then please include a detailed description with your pull request.

We are certainly open to pull requests and want to encourage people to get involved.

#### Pull request criteria

**Hot fix**
> If the pull request is a hot fix then issue the pull request to the **master** branch.

**Everything else**
> If the pull request is something more substantial then issue the pull request to the **develop** branch for testing before it is merged with master.
