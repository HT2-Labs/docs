# Contributing
There are many ways that you can contribute to the Learning Locker projects including:

- [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)
- [Issues](/issues)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Documentation](#documentation)
- [Translations](/translation)
- Promotion

## Pull requests
The best way to get started with pull requests is to create a ticket in our tracker then address the issue / enhancement in your pull request. If the pull request is in response to a bug, then no extra detail is required, however, if you are proposing new functionality or a rewrite of existing code, then please include a detailed description with your pull request. We are certainly open to pull requests and want to encourage people to get involved. If possible please create a test, this ensures that the issue you are fixing doesn't reappear and helps to show the expected behaviour.

**Hot fix**
> If the pull request is a hot fix then issue the pull request to the **master** branch.

**Everything else**
> If the pull request is something more substantial then make the pull request to the **develop** branch for testing before it is merged with master.

## Testing
We do now have some testing which can be found in the `app/tests` directory. We'd like more tests so please feel free to add some via a pull request. The tests are ran automatically on every push to the Github repository via Travis.

## Documentation
If you would like to help us document Learning Locker, here are the steps.

-  Fork the [documentation repo](https://github.com/learninglocker/docs)
-  Edit your copy
-  Issue a pull request with any changes
