## Set up

Once you download and install Learning Locker you need to register your first user, this user will become your install's super user meaning they have access to everything. 

After you create this user, you should be logged straight in. Next, it is time to set up your install. There are a couple of steps you will need to take before you are up and running. 

Click on the settings option (left hand navigation). This will take you to the basic settings page which contains the following information. Clicking edit (top right) will let you edit each setting.

*  **Name:** the global name for your install. e.g. HT2 Staff LRS
*  **Description:** a short description
*  **Site email:** the main administration email address
*  **Language:** the default language for your install (not yet wired up)
*  **Who can create a new LRS:** which type of user can create new LRSs. See [users](#users) below for details on the different user types.
*  **Registration:** open or close? If this is set to closed then any users will need to be invited in.
*  **Restrict registration:** if you decide to have open registration, you can restrict registration to a particular email domain e.g. ht2.co.uk

> If you did not set up email as part of your initial setup, you will need to manually verify the super user email. To do this click on 'users' in the left hand sidebar, you will then see users listed (there will only be one) click on the grey verified button and you will see it turn green with a tick appearing. Your email has now been verified.

## Learning Locker users

Learning Locker comes with 3 defined user roles: super, observer plus and observer.

*  **Super**: a super user (or super admin) has complete control over all aspects of the Learning Locker install. A super user can access all LRSs, delete, edit or remove them regardless of who created and can invite and remove users from the service.
*  **Observer plus**
*  **Observer**

The reason we have observer and observer plus is solely to provide an option to grant creating LRSs to a certain group of individuals.

Super users can decide which level of user can create and LRSs.

## Learning Locker site and LRSs

An install of Learning Locker lets you create a site housing as many LRSs as you need. Each LRS is private to the person who created it and anyone they invite in.
